## Dev Log / Journal

**2026-01-05:**
- Printed outercasing for Scintillator (v3) with glue
- Printed outercasing for Base (v1) with glue

**2026-01-04:**
- Printed outercasing for PMT (v1) with glue
- Successfully ran 10,000 event simulation. With better cosmic ray generation and detector geometry, (changed to the accurate 150 x 150 x 120, with teflon/tape wrapping thickness excluded from scintillator geometry)
- Verified coincidence logic between stacked detectors.
- Observed "Corner Clipping" effect in the bottom detector.

**2026-01-03:**
- Printing outercasing for Scintillator (v2)

**2026-01-02:**
- Successfully ran 10,000 event simulation. (First run: CSV data, 152.5 x 152.5 x 122.5 scintillator size)
- Obtained CSV data which showed a clear Landau Distribution.
- **Milestone:** Produced the first clean Landau distribution plots.
- Priting outercasing for Scintillator (v1)

**2026-01-01**
- Testing of the 4 bases
- Weird Signal for all four bases (even for previously verified bases #3 and #4)
- Suspecting a defect in the PMTs (though weird signal still retained even after switching PMT)

**2025-12-30**
- x100 Pin Receptacles Arrived
- Fully assembled the 2 remaining bases (4 in total). (My PCB + My Socket housing + My Bulkhead Plate + My M2 50mm screws + My soldering)

**2025-12-29**
