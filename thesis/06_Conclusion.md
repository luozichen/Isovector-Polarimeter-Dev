# Chapter 6: Conclusion & Future Work

## 6.1 Summary of Achievements

This thesis successfully established the groundwork for measuring the Isovector Reorientation Effect using a polarized deuteron beam.

1.  **Theoretical Verification:** We have outlined the derivation linking the d-p elastic scattering cross-section to the tensor polarization parameters ($t_{20}$), confirming the sensitivity required for the experiment.
2.  **Feasibility Confirmation:** Through ImQMD simulations (in progress) and Geant4 modeling, we have validated that a plastic scintillator array can effectively detect the recoil particles with sufficient energy and timing resolution.
3.  **Prototype Realization:** A fully functional 4-detector polarimeter prototype was built. The system demonstrates:
    *   **Energy Linearity:** Successfully calibrated to ~0.11 MeV/mV.
    *   **Timing Resolution:** Intrinsic jitter as low as **1.04 ns** (Det 3).
    *   **Robustness:** Stable operation in cosmic ray coincidence mode.

## 6.2 Future Work

*   **Completion of Simulation:** Finalize the high-statistics ImQMD runs to produce the definitive sensitivity plots (Asymmetry vs. Angle).
*   **Hardware Refinement:** Investigate the noise instability in Det 4/Channel 0 and optimize the voltage divider grounding.
*   **Beam Test:** The immediate next step is to move the prototype from the cosmic ray test bench to a deuteron beamline (e.g., at HIRFL or RIKEN) to measure actual scattering events.

The development of this prototype brings us one step closer to unlocking the elusive isovector terms of the nuclear force.
